#Heap Tree

This project implements a Generic Heap Tree in Java that can be used as a Max Heap or Min Heap.

## Methods:

* Put: adds a new element into the tree sorting it.
* Top: returns the element on the root (max or min).
* Extract: top method but removing the element (destructive read).

The tree starts with an initial dimension for 100 nodes. Each time the tree becomes 90% full, the data
structure is resized so it can store a higher quantity of elements.
